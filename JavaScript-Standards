JAVASCRIPT STANDARDS

Use of Camel Casing
===================

CamelCase is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the words are joined without spaces and are capitalized within the compound like BreakFast, myName etc. CamelCase is so named because each word in the identifier is put together without spaces, but with the first letter of each word captilised, looking like humps of a camel. There are two varieties in CamelCase- UpperCamelCase and lowerCamelCase. In javascript variables, references, method names are declared in lowerCamelCase.

Using Magic Numbers
=================== 

If the decision is related to true or false then only 0 and 1 should be  used.Otherwise,proper meaningful words should be  used instead of numeric values to make the code more understandable.
