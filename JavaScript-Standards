JAVASCRIPT STANDARDS

Camel Casing :

CamelCase is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the words are joined without spaces and are capitalized within the compound like BreakFast, myName etc. CamelCase is so named because each word in the identifier is put together without spaces, but with the first letter of each word captilised, looking like humps of a camel. There are two varieties in CamelCase- UpperCamelCase and lowerCamelCase. In javascript variables, references, method names are declared in lowerCamelCase.
