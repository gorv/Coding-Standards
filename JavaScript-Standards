JAVASCRIPT STANDARDS

1. Using Camel Casing
=====================

CamelCase is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the words are joined without spaces and are capitalized within the compound like BreakFast, myName etc.

2. Using Magic Numbers
====================== 

If the decision is related to true or false then only 0 and 1 should be  used.Otherwise,proper meaningful words should be used instead of numeric values to make the code more understandable.

3. Variable names must be descriptive
=====================================

There should be no variable names like x, y, a, b, flag. Variable name must properly specify what they mean.

4. Use parseInt with radix
==========================

If you parse a string to an integer, then always pass radix as 10 like parseInt("025",10), so that it does not take it to be an octet number.

5. Don't prefix variable name with _
====================================

Variables with names like _name are not allowed in JSON object, so they must be avoided.

6. Use comments wherever necessary
==================================

Use comments for telling what a variable or function do.
