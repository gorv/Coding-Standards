1. Do proper indentations.
2. Add title in head.
3. Avoid using <center>.
4. Include CSS file in <head> to load all the styles in starting.
5. Include JavaScript file in <body> after everything else to avoid errors as all the IDs and Classes would have been defined.It would be even better to make a  seperate Javascript file and include it inside head part of HTML page.
6. Take meaningful ids and class names of components.
7. Elements should be provided id in case if that element is to be used for some business logic and only once in whole html page whereas class should be provided in case that element is  used time and again.
